# Introduction

This is the website for the ERP-SCANR project. ERP-SCANR is an 'automated meta-analysis' of the literature, specifically of work that uses and studies event-related potentials (ERPs).

## Motivation

ERPs are a common method of investigation in cognitive neuroscience, so much so that there are now hundreds of thousands of papers investigating cognition, disease states, and the brain using these approaches. The scale of the literature makes it difficult to keep up to date with the field, and explore now ideas about cognitive neuroscience and this method of investigation. This issues can be especially intimidating to newcomers to the field.

Systematic reviews offer one way to gain this kind of information, but involve a large time commitment, typically lag significantly behind the literature, and may not cut across different areas of investigation.

ERP-SCANR serves mostly as a data-driven summarization tool - a way to quickly and efficiently get a quick summary of ERP components that have been characterized in the literature, and the relations between them.

## Methods

ERP-SCANR is based on the PubMed E-Utilities tools, which are used to search through PubMed databases and extract
From there, we use simple text-mining and word co-occurence analysis to derive data-driven summaries for each ERP, as well as to compare across these profiles to work towards summarizing across

This project is similar to and inspired by [Brain-SCANR.](http://www.brainscanr.com)

This project is built on the PudMed E-Utilities API, and open source tools, with thanks to Python developers and in particular those who work on nltk, BeautifulSoup. Also thanks to Github academic, where this code is hosted, and Github-Pages which is used to host this website.
