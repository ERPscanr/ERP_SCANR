# Data-Driven Profiles

For each ERP, we create a data-driven profile. The word-cloud at the top of each profile is built from the word frequency distribution of all words from abstracts of all papers that mention this ERP. There is also some aggregated meta-data, for each ERP, including the most common keywords, and most common authors and journals publishing this research.


## List of ERPs:
