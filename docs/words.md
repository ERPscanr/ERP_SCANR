# Data-Driven Profiles

For each ERP, we create a data-driven profile that summarizes the papers collected about the ERP component.

Each profile includes some summary data such as the the number of published papers, the most common keywords, and most common authors and journals publishing papers on this component, as well as a plot of the number of articles across publication year, and a wordcloud built from the distribution of words in the abstracts of all collected papers that mention this ERP.
